Create Bendy Segment Addon

This Blender addon is designed to streamline the process of creating evenly distributed control objects along a user-defined path. It is particularly useful for rigging scenarios where you might require a series of bendy segments, such as a tail, a tentacle, or a hose.

Installation

Download the addon file.
Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.
Click on the Install button and select the downloaded file.
Check the checkbox next to the addon name and click Install.
Usage

Navigate to the 3D viewport window.

In the sidebar under the Rigging category, you will find a new panel labeled Path Segments.

Within the Path Segments panel, you will find two properties:

Count: This determines the number of control objects that will be distributed along the path. The minimum value is 1, and the maximum is 1000. By default, this value is set to 6.
CurveName: This allows you to specify the name that will be assigned to both the curve object and the control objects themselves. The default name is "PathObjectSegment".
Once you have configured these properties according to your preferences, click the Create Objects Along A Path button.

Functionality

Upon clicking the button, the addon will generate the following:

A spline object based on the specified curve name. This spline serves as the underlying path for the control objects.
A series of control objects, the number of which is determined by the Count value. These control objects are named accordingly, following the pattern "cr*<curveName>\_marker*<number>".
Each control object is parented to the spline object using a Follow Path constraint. This constraint ensures that the control objects are positioned and oriented precisely along the spline path. The offset factor of the constraint for each control object is calculated automatically to ensure even distribution along the path.

Benefits of Using this Addon

This addon simplifies and accelerates the creation of complex, bendy rigs. By automating the process of generating and distributing control objects, it saves you time and effort compared to manual placement. Additionally, the even distribution of control objects ensures a smooth and natural-looking bend when manipulating the path in your rig.

I hope this comprehensive readme file clarifies the installation, usage, and advantages of this Blender addon. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.
